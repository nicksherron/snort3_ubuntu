# Installing snort3 on ubuntu
[source "Snort3 on Ubuntu 18 & 19"](https://snort-org-site.s3.amazonaws.com/production/document_files/files/000/000/211/original/Snort3.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIXACIED2SPMSC7GA%2F20200329%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200329T084137Z&X-Amz-Expires=172800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=c09c75bd73b1274844a512e369d939fcffffa171dd651b878a4e116c00d66a17)

## prep
First, ensure your system is up to date and has the latest list of packages:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
```

We will be downloading a number of source tarballs and other source files, we want to store them in
one folder:
```
mkdir ~/snort_src
cd ~/snort_src
```

## prequisites

```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential autotools-dev libdumbnet-dev \
libluajit-5.1-dev libpcap-dev zlib1g-dev pkg-config libhwloc-dev \
cmake
```

optional (but highly recommended software)

```
sudo apt-get install -y liblzma-dev openssl libssl-dev cpputest \
libsqlite3-dev uuid-dev
```

If you want to build the latest documentation from the source tree including Snort++ Developers Guide,
install the following (purely optional) packages. These packages are nearly 800 MB in size and can be
skipped unless you specifically want the dev guide:
```
sudo apt-get install -y asciidoc dblatex source-highlight w3m
```

Since we will install Snort from the github repository, we need a few tools (not necessary on Ubuntu
19):
```
sudo apt-get install -y libtool git autoconf
```

The Snort DAQ (Data Acquisition library)has a few pre-requisites that need to be installed:
```
sudo apt-get install -y bison flex
```

If you want to run Snort in inline mode using NFQ, install the required packages (not required for IDS
mode or inline mode using afpacket). If youâ€™re unsure, you should install this package.
```
sudo apt-get install -y libnetfilter-queue-dev libmnl-dev
```

Download and install safec for runtime bounds checks on certain legacy C-library calls (this is optional
but recommended):
```
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://github.com/rurban/safeclib/releases/download/v04062019/libsafec-04062019.0-ga99a05.tar.gz
tar -xzvf libsafec-04062019.0-ga99a05.tar.gz
cd libsafec-04062019.0-ga99a05/
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Install PCRE: Perl Compatible Regular Expressions. We donâ€™t use the Ubuntu repository because it has
an older version.
```
cd ~/snort_src/
wget https://ftp.pcre.org/pub/pcre/pcre-8.43.tar.gz
tar -xzvf pcre-8.43.tar.gz
cd pcre-8.43
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Download and install gperftools 2.7, googleâ€™s thread-caching malloc (used in chrome). Tcmalloc is a
memory allocator thatâ€™s optimized for high concurrency situations which will provide better speed
for the trade-off of higher memory usage. We donâ€™t want the version of tcmalloc from the Ubuntu
repository (version 2.5) as it is not compatible with Snort. Tcmalloc is optional but recommended:
```
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/releases/download/gperftools-2.7/gperftools-2.7.tar.gz
tar xzvf gperftools-2.7.tar.gz
cd gperftools-2.7
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Snort 3 uses Hyperscan for fast pattern matching. Hyperscan requires Ragel and the Boost headers:
```
cd ~/snort_src
wget http://www.colm.net/files/ragel/ragel-6.10.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ragel-6.10.tar.gz
cd ragel-6.10
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Hyperscan requires the Boost C++ Libraries. Note that we are not using the Ubuntu repository version
of the boost headers (libboost-all-dev) because Hyperscan requires boost libraries at or above version
number 1.58, and the Ubuntu repository version is too old. Download the Boost 1.71.0 libraries, but do
not install:
```
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.71.0/source/boost_1_71_0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf boost_1_71_0.tar.gz
```

Install Hyperscan 5.2 from source, referencing the location of the Boost headers source directory:
```
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://github.com/intel/hyperscan/archive/v5.2.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf v5.2.0.tar.gz
mkdir ~/snort_src/hyperscan-5.2.0-build
cd hyperscan-5.2.0-build/
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DBOOST_ROOT=~/snort_src/boost_1_71_0/ ../hyperscan-5.2.0
make
sudo make install
```

If you want to test that Hyperscan works, from the build directory, run:
```
cd ~/snort_src/hyperscan-5.2.0-build/
./bin/unit-hyperscan
```

Snort has an optional requirement for flatbuers, A memory eicient serialization library:
```
cd ~/snort_src
wget https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/archive/v1.11.0.tar.gz \
  -O flatbuffers-v1.11.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf flatbuffers-v1.11.0.tar.gz
mkdir flatbuffers-build
cd flatbuffers-build
cmake ../flatbuffers-1.11.0
make
sudo make install
```

Next, download and install Data AcQuisition library (DAQ) from the Snort website. Note that Snort 3
uses a different DAQ than the Snort 2.9.x.x series:
```
cd ~/snort_src
git clone https://github.com/snort3/libdaq.git
cd libdaq
./bootstrap
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Update shared libraries:
```
sudo ldconfig
```
## install

Now we are ready to download, compile, and install Snort 3 from the github repository. If you are
interested in enabling additional compile-time functionality, such as the ability to process large (over 2
GB) PCAP files, or the new command line shell, you should run ./configure cmake.sh --help to
list all possible options. If you want to install to a different location, please see Appendix B.
Download and install, with default settings:

```
cd ~/snort_src
git clone git://github.com/snortadmin/snort3.git
cd snort3
./configure_cmake.sh --prefix=/usr/local --enable-tcmalloc
cd build
make
sudo make install
```

The last step ins the installation is to verify that the Snort installed and can run. To do this, we pass the
snort executable it the -V flag:
```
/usr/local/bin/snort -v
```
